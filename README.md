# Overview

Picam2ctrl is a MQTT client based on new [Picamera2 API](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2 ) with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) discovery support.

## General Restriction

Since [Picamera2](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2) is currently only available as a [beta release](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2#readme) *picam2ctrl* can break with newer *Picamera2* releases.

More details about the new libcamera-based Python-API for Raspberry Pi camera you can find [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/camera_software.html ).

# Features

MQTT client to control your Raspberry Pi Camera with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

* actual 10 different MQTT client entities
* taking snapshot pictures
* capturing MP4 videos incl. audio
* RTSP video streaming of camera to RTSP server mediaMTX / go2rtsp / frigate
* simple HTTP MJPEG streaming server
* UDP video streaming
* motion/occupancy detection by camera
* picamera tuning controls support
* timestamp support
* time elapse video support
* PAN / TILT camera support with 5V Stepper Motor (28BYJ-48) and ULN2003 driver board (optinal)
* PAN-TILT Hat by Waveshare integrated incl. lighsensor
* support of secure copy latest picture- / video-files to SSH server

# Installation

Raspberry Pi OS bullseye version is required and camera legacy mode must be disabled in raspi-config.
On headless Raspberry Pi OS lite you have to update from *libcamera-apps-lite* to full version *libcamera-apps*.
No gui but OpenCV python bindings and paho-mqtt package are required:

  ```
  sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libcamera-apps python3-picamera2 python3-opencv python3-paho-mqtt python3-smbus ffmpeg git
  ```

finally clone the picam2ctrl repository:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/irimitenkan/picam2ctrl.git
  ```

## Installation & Calibration of Waveshare's Pan-Tilt Hat (optional)

For 1st setup the calibration of the servos is required to avoid a damage when the servos are assembled, i.e. that must be done *BEFORE* the Pan-Tilt Hat is assembled completly. After that the servomotors are set to 0Â° degrees. Keep in mind you still have to consider the angles for assignment of the CAM direction when you assemble the hat.

According to Waweshare's [documentation](https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/b/b9/Pan-Tilt_HAT_user_manual_en.pdf) there is a test program for servo adjustment but it requires WiringPi which has been removed from Bullseye's repro. WiringPi package is still available at [github](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi/releases/download/2.61-1/wiringpi-2.61-1-armhf.deb) but we can use here a python script instead. It is available at this picam2ctrl repro.

Hence:

* enable I2C in raspi-config (Interface options -> I2C -> enable)
* python smbus is required:

  ```
  sudo apt install python3-smbus
  ```

* only connect Pan & Tilt servos to hat
* connect hat with Raspberry Pi
* execute servoTest

  ```
  python pantilt/waveshare/servoTest.py
  ```

* proceed with Pan-Tilt Hat assembling see Waveshare's [guideline](https://www.waveshare.com/img/devkit/accBoard/Pan-Tilt-HAT/Pan-Tilt-HAT-assemble.jpg)

* finally enable Pan-Tilt Hat in config.json if not already done

  ```
  "PanTilt":{
     "active":"WAVESHARE_HAT",

# PAN-Tilt-Hardware

## ULN2003 with 5V step motor(s) 28BYJ-48

The PAN camera can be realized with a step-motor which can be controlled with 4 GPIO ports of your Raspberry Pi.

You need to buy a [5V step motor 28BYJ-48 with ULN2003 driver board](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ULN2003+driver+board+28BYJ-48).

Howto setup the hardware wiring you can find e.g.[here](https://diyprojectslab.com/28byj-48-stepper-motor-with-raspberry-pi-pico/) or [here](https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/RpiMotorLib/blob/master/Documentation/28BYJ.md).

Finally we need a construction to pan the connected Raspberry Pi Camera with above mentioned step-motor. As solution a Raspberry Pi housing with camera integration support is recommended: we pan the complete Raspberry Pi case.

My 1st prototype is using the [Raspberry Pi 3 case](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-case/) with a wide angle camera.
Here is an [image of the PAN camera prototype](https://github.com/irimitenkan/picam2ctrl/blob/main/images/Mounted_Prototype_1.jpg) and some construction details [Mounting_Prototype_1.jpg](https://github.com/irimitenkan/picam2ctrl/blob/main/images/Mounting_Prototype_1.jpg) & [Mounting_Prototype_2.jpg](https://github.com/irimitenkan/picam2ctrl/blob/main/images/Mounting_Prototype_2.jpg)
